	<name>Outlier Detector</name>
	<shortDescription>
		Detects and handles outliers for all numerical
		columns.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			<p>
				This node detects and treats the outliers for each of the selected columns
				individually by means of
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlier#Tukey's_fences">interquartile range (IQR)</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				To detect the outliers for a given column, the first and
				third
				quartile (Q<sub>1</sub>, Q<sub>3</sub>) is computed.
				An observation is flagged an outlier if it lies
				outside the range
				R = [Q<sub>1</sub> - k(IQR), Q<sub>3</sub> + k(IQR)] with
				IQR = Q<sub>3</sub> - Q<sub>1</sub>	and k &gt;= 0.
				Setting k = 1.5 the smallest value in R corresponds,
				typically, to the lower end of a boxplot's whisker and largest value
				to its upper end.
				<br />
				Providing grouping information allows to further detect
				outliers only within their respective groups. Columns for which
				outliers have to be detected will be skipped when computing the groups.
			</p>
			<p>
				If an observation is flagged an outlier, one can either remove
				the whole row from the data or replace it by some other value.
			</p>
			<p>
				Missing values contained in the data will be ignored, i.e., they
				will neither be used for the outlier computation nor will they be
				flagged as an outlier.
			</p>
		</intro>
		<tab name="Outlier Selection (Outlier Settings)">
			<option name="Outlier selection">
				Allows the selection of columns for which outliers have to be
				detected
				and treated. If "Compute outlier statistics on groups" (see tab "Group Settings") is selected,
				the outliers for each of the columns are computed solely with respect
				to the different groups.
			</option>

		</tab>
		
		<tab name="General settings (Outlier Settings)">
			<option name="IQR multiplier (k)">
				Allows to scale the interquartile range (IQR).
				The default is k = 1.5.
			</option>
			
			<option name="Update domain">
				If checked the domain of the selected outlier columns
				is updated.
			</option>

			<option name="Process in memory">
				Process the table in the memory. Requires more
				memory, but is faster
				since the table does not need to be sorted in advance.
				If in memory is selected more accurate values of 
				Q<sub>1</sub> and Q<sub>3</sub>
				are computed, otherwise these quartiles will
				entirely be estimated
				irrespective of the selected "Estimation type".
				<br />
				<br />
				Note that the more accurate computation of the quartiles comes
				with higher memory requirements. If the additionally required memory
				exceeds the available memory this node will fail.
			</option>

			<option name="Estimation type">
				Typically the value of the quartiles is not part of the input, but
				lies between two observations. The estimation type allows to specify
				how to deal with this problem, e.g., by using linear-interpolation.
				A detailed explanation of the different options can be found

			</option>

		</tab>

		<tab name="Outlier treatment (Outlier Settings)">

			<option name="Treatment">
				Defines two different strategies to treat outliers:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>Replace Value:</b>
						Allows to replace outliers based on the selected "Replacement
						strategy"
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Remove Row:</b>
						Removes all rows from the input data that contain in any of the
						selected columns at least one outlier
					</li>

				</ul>
			</option>

			<option name="Replacement strategy ">
				Defines two different strategies to replace
				outliers:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>Missing values:</b>
						Replaces every outlier by a missing value
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Closest permitted value:</b>
						Replaces the value of each outlier by the closest value within the
						permitted interval R. If the column type is an integer the
						replacement value is the closest integer within the permitted interval.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</option>

		</tab>
		
		<tab name="Group Selection (Group Settings)">
			<option name="Compute outlier statistics on groups">
				If enabled, allows the selection of columns to identify groups. A group comprises all
				rows of the input exhibiting the same values in every single column (similar to the GroupBy node).
				The outliers will finally be computed with respect to each of the
				individual groups.
			</option>
			<option name="Column Filter">
			     Move the columns defining the groups into the Include list. The group definition will take priority,
			     i.e. if a column is selected for both group definition and outlier handling, 
			     it will be used to define groups (no outlier handling done for that column).
